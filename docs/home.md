?> MemeAssembly v0.2 is out! Check out the [releases page](https://github.com/kammt/MemeAssembly/releases) for more information
    
## Why code in MemeAssembly anyway?
MemeAssembly is the best choice for...
### ...Silicon Valley Developers
When it comes to programs, speed is everything. No user wants to wait minutes for their app to start or to calculate a result. 
Thanks to MemeAssembly, these worries are no more! Due to MemeAssembly's high level of optimisation, your code will be blazingly fast!

### ...Game Developers
According to NVIDIA, "Frames win games". \
While high-level programming languages like Java provide a lot of pre-coded Interfaces and classes, they do have one giant drawback: *Speed*. \
This could once again be seen by the release of Cyberpunk 2077. Even if the game is great, low performance can be a deal-breaker for most if not all customers! \
So don't miss out on your potential revenue and give your gamers the highest tier performance - using MemeAssembly!

### ...Security Analysts
Have you ever asked yourself one of the following questions:
- How does my program react if there is a Segmentation Fault?
- How does my program respond to Buffer Overflows?
- How easy is it for an attacker to reverse-engineer my source code and create vulnerabilities for it?

MemeAssembly adresses all three! Intentionally cause SegFaults or overflow a buffer using just one command. Furthermore, your source-code will be impossible to analyse, as MemeASM code is hard to read by nature.

### ...children learning to code
Motivating children to join Computer Science related studies or simply learning to code has been a challenge for years. The solution for this problem is simple yet effective: Learn to code using MemeAssembly. \
[Numerous studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) have alredy proven the effectivity of MemeAssembly. Parents often praise MemeAssembly's apprach of combining low-level programming languages with Memes that are easy to remember.
