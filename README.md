# MemeAssembly
A highly advanced x86-Assembly based programming language using only memes as commands

# Commands overview
- stonks <value> - pushes a value to the stack
- not stonks <destination> - pops a value from the stack
- upgrade ... fuck go back - defines a marker and jumps back to that marker at a later point
- <comand> or draw 25 - the compiler will completely disregard the command before and instead add 25 to the register *eax*
