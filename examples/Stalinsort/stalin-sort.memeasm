What the hell happened here? This program takes a pointer to the array in rdi, the number of elements as a pointer in rsi. No value is returned, but the array and the array size are modified
I like to have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun stalinSort

    What the hell happened here? The following register setup is defined:
    What the hell happened here?    - rdi   pointer to the array
    What the hell happened here?    - rsi   pointer to the array size
    What the hell happened here?
    What the hell happened here?    - r8    loop counter
    What the hell happened here?    - r9    new array size
    What the hell happened here?    - r10   temporary register for comparisons
    What the hell happened here?    - rax   pointer to the next array element that was not in order (i.e. it can be overwritten
    What the hell happened here?    - ecx   the last array element that was in order

    What the hell happened here? Set up our loop counters
    sneak 100 r8
    sneak 100 r9

    What the hell happened here? Move the first value into the destination
    ecx is brilliant, but I like rdi do you know de wey
    rax is brilliant, but I like rdi

    What the hell happened here? Move our pointers along
    rdi units are ready, with 4 more well on the way
    rax units are ready, with 4 more well on the way

    What the hell happened here? Increase our loop counters
    upvote r8
    upvote r9

    corporate needs you to find the difference between r8 and rsi do you know de wey

    upgrade
        What the hell happened here? Move the current value into r10d
        r10d is brilliant, but I like rdi do you know de wey
        who would win? r10d or ecx

        What the hell happened here? If r10d is greater, then this value is in order. Move it into our sorted array
        r10d wins
        rax do you know de wey is brilliant, but I like r10d
        What the hell happened here? Update ecx to feature the new largest value
        ecx is brilliant, but I like r10d
        rax units are ready, with 4 more well on the way
        upvote r9

        ecx wins
        rdi units are ready, with 4 more well on the way
        upvote r8

        corporate needs you to find the difference between r8 and rsi do you know de wey
    fuck go back

    What the hell happened here? If all elements were traversed, we land here
    they're the same picture

    What the hell happened here? Update the array size
    rsi do you know de wey is brilliant, but I like r9

    right back at ya, buckaroo
